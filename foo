1: Can Human Ideals Survive the Internet?	2023-06-19	The argument based on interactivity would have us say, in effect, “Look how much greener than the desert this new, semiarid land is!” 	
1: Can Human Ideals Survive the Internet?	2023-06-19	The truth of the matter is that the mind contains nothing of enduring value. Its assets -- and the very substance of its achievement -- reside in its own, rigorously disciplined, revelatory shape, its flexibility, its strengthened vividness, its powers of attention and concentration, its self-awareness, its capacity for reverence and devotion.	
1: Can Human Ideals Survive the Internet?	2023-06-19	the large corporation today, recognized in law as a kind of nonpersonal person, operates rather like a computer	
1: Can Human Ideals Survive the Internet?	2023-06-19	a habit of abstraction through which inner qualities such as personal respect disappear into mechanisms.	
1: Can Human Ideals Survive the Internet?	2023-06-19	we find the computer bringing to near completion the severing of the word from its live source in the individual	
1: Can Human Ideals Survive the Internet?	2023-06-19	When I am speaking to the individual as he sits at his computer, I cannot point and say either “good!” or “bad!” We're not in that universe of discourse. All I can say is, “Enliven the word! Work at enlivening the word! If you cannot do so, you will lose yourself! Like it or not, the computer is with us to stay. So far as you are required to use it, you must redeem it or you will become like it.” Where the individual's sovereign freedom rules, I speak of choices, and cannot prescribe.	
1: Can Human Ideals Survive the Internet?	2023-06-19	It is always ourselves we work on, whether we realize it or not. There is no other work to be done in the world.	
4: Settlers in Cyberspace	2023-06-21	The Net demands a higher order of communal awareness from a society that has already failed badly at the “easier” levels.	
4: Settlers in Cyberspace	2023-06-21	When we're all in the electronic marketplace together, will our enemy be any less ourselves than when we were all in the industrial marketplace together? When the Net subsumes all social functions, will the balance of healthy and destructive forces be more positive than we already know it to be?	
4: Settlers in Cyberspace	2023-06-21	Will the individual citizen then find it easier to affect the political process, or will the sheer, inundative bulk and sophistication of machine-assisted, well-financed activism put politics even more out of reach than the TV-driven juggernauts of our own day?	
4: Settlers in Cyberspace	2023-06-21	I am convinced that much of the “community” we experience is more an effort to bury the loneliness than to reckon with its causes. And I suspect that the causes have a lot to do with our failure to acknowledge, let alone to have any useful language for grasping, the spiritual self whose cut-off condition is at issue.	
3: The Future Does Not Compute	2023-06-21	Computers didn't bring anything essentially new; they were just going to be better machines than we had yet managed to be.	
3: The Future Does Not Compute	2023-06-21	Have you, or has anyone you know, ever made an important decision by weighing all related factors, adding them up, and then obeying the sum? This is not really your future we're talking about; it's your past. The real question is, what do you choose to become -- despite what you are now? 	
5: On Being Responsible for Earth	2023-06-22	all that is best in the uniquely Western development of scientific discipline: the habit of rigorous, detached observation, the finely tuned mental machinery of analysis, the requirement that theories work	
5: On Being Responsible for Earth	2023-06-22	his ill-advised singling out of Ronald Reagan	
5: On Being Responsible for Earth	2023-06-22	Mander repeats uncritically the wholly uncertain claim that we face crises of ozone depletion and global warming	
6: Networks and Communities	2023-06-23	What hope is there for peace and human rights when I conceive the barriers separating me from my fellows to be mere obstructions on a network technology diagram rather than the powers of darkness shadowing my own heart?	
6: Networks and Communities	2023-06-23	Community is, in the first instance, something to be salvaged from information technology, not furthered by it. There is surely a case to be made (and many have made it) that the telephone, automobile, radio, and television have all contributed to social fragmentation, personal isolation, and alienation from both self and other.	
6: Networks and Communities	2023-06-23	we have to acknowledge that the order is substantially biased in advance, because the forms of the basic technology already reflect what we have become -- and it happens that what we have become can be read in our existing, television-centered culture.	
6: Networks and Communities	2023-06-23	We're no longer going to let those TV moguls keep us down and reveling in smut.	
6: Networks and Communities	2023-06-23	Who constitutes the society that isolated them in the first place -- persons different from those who will make the Net whatever it becomes? 	
6: Networks and Communities	2023-06-23	But have you noticed how easily “network” now seems almost to imply “community” -- as if a set of electronic connections automatically constituted community?	
7: At the Fringe of Freedom	2023-06-24	Freedom, you might say, is not a state, but a tension, a name for the process of becoming free.	
7: At the Fringe of Freedom	2023-06-24	the issue is whether our historical abandonment of institutions based on personal trust has led to independence, or instead to a more thoroughgoing -- if also a more diffuse and unaccountable -- dependence upon a system over which one has almost no control at all.	
7: At the Fringe of Freedom	2023-06-24	absurd, guilt-driven expressions of political correctness	
8: Things That Run by Themselves	2023-06-25	If the slightest slackness on my part means that someone else is going to beat me to market, then clearly there's no reason for me to worry about the supposed need remaining unmet! So I must in fact be worrying about something else: keeping up with the treadmill.	
8: Things That Run by Themselves	2023-06-25	there are many signs that we are inclined rather to let things run by themselves, as the whole, broad, technical thrust of our society already does	
8: Things That Run by Themselves	2023-06-25	the computer runs by itself with an attitude. It not only runs like a traditional machine, but also receives a dimmed-down, mechanical -- yet technically effective -- shadow of our inner life, and then sets that to running by itself.	
8: Things That Run by Themselves	2023-06-25	We're talking about the danger of things that run by themselves.	
8: Things That Run by Themselves	2023-06-25	What “independent” forces are at work here, sabotaging the wishes of everyone involved?	
9: Do We Really Want a Global Village?	2023-06-26	how many students of mathematics still look to the night sky with wonder?	
9: Do We Really Want a Global Village?	2023-06-26	A global village that leaves no place for native or alternative cultures seems uncomfortably like the old colonialism in a new guise. 	
9: Do We Really Want a Global Village?	2023-06-26	without a proper foundation within the depths of the human being	
9: Do We Really Want a Global Village?	2023-06-26	could it be that what we so eagerly embrace, unawares, are the powers of dissolution themselves?	
9: Do We Really Want a Global Village?	2023-06-27	When we disrupt this meaning with our detached logic and unrooted information, we cast the villagers into the same void that we have been able to endure only by filling it with endless diversions	
9: Do We Really Want a Global Village?	2023-06-27	in attacking any local problem we must yield first of all, not to the meanings inherent in the problem, but to the constraining necessity of the global system itself. The village farmers in Nepal may not feel any need of a satellite dish, but they will receive one nevertheless	
9: Do We Really Want a Global Village?	2023-06-27	"“It is discomforting,” writes Denis Goulet,

for a sophisticated technical expert from a rich country to learn that men who live on the margin of subsistence and daily flirt with death and insecurity are sometimes capable of greater happiness, wisdom, and human communion than he is, notwithstanding his knowledge, wealth, and technical superiority./4/

This is not to justify the continued existence of poverty, but only to point toward the inner world from"	
11: In Summary	2023-06-29	Where, as a child, I differentiated myself from the animal, now I must learn to differentiate myself from the machine -- and this differentiation lies in the deepening of consciousness.	
11: In Summary	2023-06-29	Therefore, even to argue that there is a threat from computers -- if that threat is seen as fixed and objective -- is only to further our descent. This is my own greatest challenge, for where my strong predilection is to argue the facts, I should instead seek to awaken. Awakenings prepare the way for a new future, and for different facts.	
11: In Summary	2023-06-29	one can imagine a brave new world in which we have eliminated all but the desired effects, yet in which we steadily descend to the level of our machines	
11: In Summary	2023-06-29	I am not sure we will be given this many decades to become properly aware of our computers. For what is directly at risk now -- what the computer asks us to abdicate -- are our independent powers of awareness. Yet these powers are the only means by which we can raise ourselves above the machine.	
12: Net-based Learning Communities	2023-06-30	But a dramatic and ill-advised movement toward online education may well be the one smoke screen fully capable of preventing an aroused public's focus upon the issues that really count.	
12: Net-based Learning Communities	2023-06-30	There is, after all, one absolutely unavoidable fact: technologies for “bringing people together” do not necessarily bring people together.	
12: Net-based Learning Communities	2023-06-30	Can we rightly complain, van den Berg asked, when the child grows up and somehow fails to “adjust”? Adjust to what? Nothing is there -- everything is abstract, distant, invisible! And so the modern outcome seems inevitable: the child is forced to live within an inner fantasyland, cut off from the nurturing, reassuring matrix of structures and authorities that once constituted community. No wonder the surreal world of the video game is his natural habitat. Nor will it do any good to trash the video games, if we find no way to replace them with a real and appealing community.	
13: Impressing the Science out of Children	2023-07-01	In the video image, it is not the world that speaks, except indirectly, by means of abstractions wholly beyond the child's ability to understand	
13: Impressing the Science out of Children	2023-07-01	There is a difference between “special effects wonder” and the true wonder that leads toward a devout scientific curiosity	
13: Impressing the Science out of Children	2023-07-01	television nature programs -- presumably much more impressive than the city park or the woods out back -- offer no particular encouragement for children to become naturalists	
14: Children of the Machine	2023-07-02	the mere fact of sparking a child's enthusiastic assent does not prove an activity healthy	
14: Children of the Machine	2023-07-02	all knowledge is knowledge of the human being. It is true that we've tried to structure many fields of knowledge as if their content were wholly unrelated to the human being -- but not even in physics has this effort succeeded	
14: Children of the Machine	2023-07-02	the inner significance the material carries for the teacher -- these are infinitely more important to the child than any bare, informational content	
14: Children of the Machine	2023-07-02	taught to make the translation, “this attention is captured and expressed by a numerical algorithm governing motion in space.”	
14: Children of the Machine	2023-07-02	There is no neat algorithm for either carving or sailing a little wooden boat in the usual, childlike manner -- and yet these activities offer a great deal of worthwhile experience, from which a later appreciation of mathematics and engineering can most healthily arise.	
14: Children of the Machine	2023-07-02	We should at least ask what developing capacities of the child feed upon the forms and substances of nature before we casually substitute for them our latter-day artifices./2/	
14: Children of the Machine	2023-07-02	It is simply backward to immerse the elementary school student in an artificial, computerized environment before he has learned much at all about the world. How can he translate the terms of artifice, the language of representation, back into a reality he has never known?	
14: Children of the Machine	2023-07-02	the virtue of immediacy possessed by the technical device as such is not a virtue of the content mediated by that device	
14: Children of the Machine	2023-07-02	"He cautions us at one point to be “on the lookout for insidious forms of abstractness that may not be recognized by those who use them” (p. 146).

The only reasonable course here is to honor his counsel by turning it respectfully upon his own work./1/"	
14: Children of the Machine	2023-07-02	What has happened here is that the artistic task has been embedded within a programming task.	
14: Children of the Machine	2023-07-02	our perplexity, verging finally on incredulity, as we read that computer technology is to be the primary instrument for overcoming abstraction	
14: Children of the Machine	2023-07-02	One wants so badly to like what Seymour Papert has done.	
16: The Tyranny of the Detached Word	2023-07-04	Many researchers in cognitive science think they spy the essence of intelligence in the formal shuffling of symbols	
17: The Great Information Hunt	2023-07-05	The hope resounding through the rhetorical atmosphere of the information age is that, having submitted our lives and society to a logic of ones and zeros, we can ascend again to meaning	
17: The Great Information Hunt	2023-07-05	The computer willingly places its mimicking intelligence at our service. All it asks of us is one small thing: that we allow it to start with information or data, and to proceed from there by means of mechanized logic.	
17: The Great Information Hunt	2023-07-05	What the computer sees issuing from me is information./6/ And everything it does is founded on this kind of seeing.	
17: The Great Information Hunt	2023-07-05	It is the progressive dimming of our interior spaces that enables us to to imagine them out there	
17: The Great Information Hunt	2023-07-05	the Net is the most pronounced manifestation yet of our tendency to reconceive the human interior in the manner of an exterior, and then to project it onto the external world	
17: The Great Information Hunt	2023-07-05	Data, on the other hand, are the final, abstract precipitate of a fading wisdom -- a lifeless and meaningless residue. There can be no reconstitution of wisdom solely from this residue	
17: The Great Information Hunt	2023-07-05	Data and information are the raw materials of wisdom. That is the lie.	
17: The Great Information Hunt	2023-07-05	this peculiar word, “information,” has escaped the constraints hindering all merely mortal terms./3/ This is shown by the fact that no one who hails the Age of Information would be equally ecstatic about an Age of Opinion, or Age of Gossip, or Age of Random Bits	
17: The Great Information Hunt	2023-07-05	The hypertext “button” is close cousin to the remote control button, and the joltingly syncopated rhythms of channel surfing prove equally apt for Netsurfing	
17: The Great Information Hunt	2023-07-06	The self-possessed individual moves only according to his own necessities, even as he serves the needs of others. This is what we should hope to celebrate: the end of empowerment. We do not need power, whether over others or over the world. We need wisdom, and the ability to connect with our own destinies.	
17: The Great Information Hunt	2023-07-06	One can, in this regard, venture a fairly safe prediction: over the coming years, fringe Net phenomena such as flame wars, weird impersonations, the more bizarre forms of underground culture, pornographic commerce, manifestations of psychosis ... will grow increasingly pronounced and erratic, while at the same time the reasoned mechanisms for filtering “strict business” from the more chaotic background noise of the Net will steadily gain in effectiveness.	
17: The Great Information Hunt	2023-07-06	an Information Society in which wealth, power and freedom of action derive from access to, and effective use of, information.	
19: Listening for the Silence	2023-07-08	Why do I call down upon myself so much “half-important” material, if not to satisfy some sort of profitless information greed?	
19: Listening for the Silence	2023-07-08	Computers, so far as they act in their own right, are exchangers of information, not meaning	
19: Listening for the Silence	2023-07-08	That is why machine translation only works (to some extent) with highly formalized (that is, relatively empty) vocabularies typical of certain sciences and scholarly disciplines. Such languages are designed to eliminate all meaning, to squeeze out every contaminant that might infect the spaces between the words.	
18: And the Word Became Mechanical	2023-07-08	When speech detaches itself from the speaker, it is indeed objectified, cut off from its human source. But it still carries -- if only via our subconscious -- some of its ancient and living powers. And so its association with machinery readily evokes our personification of the machinery.	
18: And the Word Became Mechanical	2023-07-08	She was simply conversing with words	
20: Awaking from the Primordial Dream	2023-07-09	We can, that is, work to encompass with renewed consciousness what has previously fallen from awareness -- not by sinking ourselves back into dream, but by taking hold in full wakefulness of the wisdom that once possessed the dreaming childhood of the race. This is the task of imagination.	
20: Awaking from the Primordial Dream	2023-07-09	what he let loose over Hiroshima, after fiddling with its exterior for three centuries like a mechanical toy, was the forces of his own unconscious mind	
20: Awaking from the Primordial Dream	2023-07-09	Ancient man, while dreaming, was at least dreaming of the powers enlivening the world. He thereby knew them, however dimly. We, on the other hand, have gained our acute, materially effective consciousness only at the cost of losing altogether our awareness of the life within things	
20: Awaking from the Primordial Dream	2023-07-09	What we meet in the computer is a kind of pure, unblinking wakefulness, an unsurpassed logical clarity with no awareness of content, a consciousness that has contracted to a nullity, so that the only things left to it are the empty logical forms of its own perfect acuity.	
20: Awaking from the Primordial Dream	2023-07-09	Our love of the prefix meta- today testifies to our inveterate habit of stepping back to consider every subject from a yet higher vantage point.	
20: Awaking from the Primordial Dream	2023-07-09	While the wisdom of the ancients was certainly not a technological or scientific savvy, we cannot for that reason alone dismiss it. That would be like criticizing the tern for its inability to conceptualize modern navigational theory.	
21: Mona Lisa's Smile	2023-07-11	Virtual realities promise endless fascination without any apparent risk that the horror of the real world might leak through.	
21: Mona Lisa's Smile	2023-07-11	Is it our real yearning simply to become alive again, and to know the world as living?	QAnon
21: Mona Lisa's Smile	2023-07-11	our own interiors overflowed with a perplexing subjectivity we knew less and less what to do with?	
21: Mona Lisa's Smile	2023-07-11	Could it be that this death of the world is what engenders our passion for virtual realities? Do we seek again the spirits that the ancients once found so easily within stream and meadow, tree and mountain?	
22: Seeing in Perspective	2023-07-12	Barfield would have you contemplate some such proposition as this: if all life, all knowing and cognizing spirit, were removed from the universe, then nothing else -- no objects -- would be left either. No sun, moon, earth, or stars. Such a thought taken seriously is -- even for those who construct virtual realities -- forbidden by what our minds have become. And yet, as Barfield reminds us, it would have been just as impossible either to feel or think the proposition's denial during the medieval era.	
22: Seeing in Perspective	2023-07-12	As I remarked earlier, we all know that the world comes in perspective. Yet this “simple” fact was not noticed by highly skilled mathematicians and artists prior to the Renaissance.	
22: Seeing in Perspective	2023-07-12	We speak of “immersive” virtual reality, but it is immersion in a “nothing” that is compounded of mathematical abstractions and cut off from Nature's lawfulness.	
22: Seeing in Perspective	2023-07-12	GalileO's world-changing instrument pushed the moon farther from us. Where once we felt ourselves within the moon's sphere of influence, we woke up to find the moon far, far away, unconnected to ourselves.	
22: Seeing in Perspective	2023-07-12	the perspectival rendering of a photograph couldn't appear lifelike to us if the world had not become photolike	
22: Seeing in Perspective	2023-07-12	Before the scientific revolution the world was more like a garment men wore about them than a stage on which they moved	
22: Seeing in Perspective	2023-07-12	But in discovering the practical rules of strict, geometric perspective, he performed a momentous act of abstraction that hastened the world upon its vanishing course.	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-13	Thus mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true	Compare Russell here, to Szegedy the villain. Do they agree?
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-13	It was Wittgenstein who remarked, “All propositions of logic mean the same thing, namely nothing.”	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-13	"the meaning of “it is true that” -- is exactly the same in both these sentences. It is indeed the same in a potentially infinite number of sentences of the form,

It is true that ( . . . ),"	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-13	meaning (or expressiveness) and accuracy are polar contraries	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-13	What we need in order to find a counterpoint to accuracy is, as Barfield shows, the relation of polar contraries	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-13	The computer therefore may give us a gift: the opportunity to recognize meaning as the void at the computer's heart. And it likewise presents us with a challenge: to overcome the void, or rather fill it with our humanity.	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-14	nearly all linguistic symbols have a figurative origin	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-14	that quality which makes some people say: “That is self-evident” or “that is obviously true,” and which makes others say: “That is a tautology,” is precisely the quality which meaning hasn't got	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-14	Newton's use of gravitas to describe the force of gravitation was metaphorical -- untrue on its face; it made no more sense, given the received meaning of gravitas, than we would make today if we explained the moon's revolution as resulting from its desire for the earth. And yet, as with many metaphors, it did make sense when one looked through the false statements and, with their essential aid, began to grasp the intended (new) meanings.	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-14	Thinking logically is what we find we have done when we have successfully struggled to remain faithful to our meanings	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-14	we dare not start with the distinction between self and not-self; for that distinction actually disappears every time we think	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-14	surely I cannot define meaning with meaningless terms	This is not obvious to me. It is certainly not a tautology like he claims.
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-14	the polarity between meaning and accuracy is also -- within the individual consciousness -- a polarity between fullness and clarity. And we run the risk of becoming, finally, absolutely clear about nothing at all.	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-14	regardless of how their terms are taken	Sleight of hand here. I thought we had carefully defined “man” and “mortal”, and so how can he say “regardless”?
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-15	Every claim that “the computer cannot do so-and-so” is met by the effort -- more or less successful -- to analyze so-and-so into a set of pure, formal structures.	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-15	you can't take the nonpolar end products of (the programmer's) analysis, map them to the computational structures of a computer, and expect them to climb back into the polar dynamic from which they were extracted -- any more than you can reduce a conversation to a bare logical structure, and then expect anyone to derive from that structure the concrete substance of the original conversation.	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-15	as Barfield points out, “It is just those meanings which attempt to be most exclusively material ... which are also the most generalized and abstract -- i.e. remote from reality.”	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-15	Abstract thinking is, in the extreme, counting: we count instances, but do not try to say instances of what.	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-15	For us, absence of meaning is the given, and its rediscovery requires a sometimes painful inner movement in opposition to the prevailing spirit of our time.	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-15	The problem is knowing when a conclusion really does violate the calculus. What about “the earth is a planet,” spoken by a contemporary of Copernicus? If we consider only the then-received meanings of “earth” and “planet,” there is indeed a violation of the logical calculus	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-15	The imagination is forever discovering new unities, while rational analysis is forever dissecting them	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-15	every imaginative unity stands ready to be broken apart by analysis	
25: What This Book Was About	2023-07-16	It is one thing to transmit text across a computer network, but quite another when machines are employed to read the text and interpret it, or to translate it into different languages -- or to compose the text in the first place.	
24: Electronic Mysticism	2023-07-16	Whatever it is that most essentially distinguishes us from computers, I am convinced that it is intimately related to the powers with which we may successfully pursue exercises in historical imagination	
24: Electronic Mysticism	2023-07-16	They looked within, and they were aware of little more than the operations of a sophisticated calculator. This should give us pause. What crippling of human consciousness -- evident in even the best minds of the modern era -- could have yielded such a grotesquely flawed and inadequate self-awareness?	
24: Electronic Mysticism	2023-07-16	Herbert Simon's 1965 statement that “machines will be capable, within 20 years, of doing any work that a man can do.”	
24: Electronic Mysticism	2023-07-16	"we aspire to a role like the one I described for the gods. And it is therefore reasonable to ask: what manner of gods will we be?

We do not seem very interested in this question. We spend much time debating what manner of intelligence our machines are manifesting, and toward what future goal they are evolving. But we are less inclined to ask toward what goal we are evolving. Perhaps we and our machines are converging upon the same goal -- converging, that is, upon each other. Certainly if our computers are becoming ever more humanlike, then it goes without saying that we are becoming ever more computerlike. Who, we are well advised to ask, is doing the most changing?"	
24: Electronic Mysticism	2023-07-16	they might have chosen, with Tolkien, to “make by the law in which they were made” -- they contrive instead to fashion a child-mind wholly emergent from its physical substrate	
24: Electronic Mysticism	2023-07-16	One milestone in this development occurred only a few centuries ago, when the words “subject” and “object” completed a rather dramatic reversal of meaning	
24: Electronic Mysticism	2023-07-16	THE FORMALIST'S MOTTO: If the programmer takes care of the syntax, the program's meaning will [somehow] take care of itself	
24: Electronic Mysticism	2023-07-16	“the properties of immutability and impenetrability ascribed to atoms are the last degenerate forms of divine attributes.”	
24: Electronic Mysticism	2023-07-16	Part of Achilles' mental functioning was not his own, but the gift of Athena. He was not capable of forming theories about her or “using” her to explain events; the “presence of mind” by which the theory- former would eventually be born was only now being brought down to earth.	
24: Electronic Mysticism	2023-07-16	Owen Barfield's remark that “it is not man who made the myths, but the myths that made man.”	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-16	condemned to echo futilely and forever the possibilities inherent in the last thoughts of their creators	
23: Can We Transcend Computation?	2023-07-16	On the one hand, there is no meaning we cannot implant within the computer, so long as we are willing to identify the meaning with a set of precisely elaborated logical structures. On the other hand, however complex and intricate the elaboration -- however many layers we construct -- the computer as a computational device remains outside the living polarity of truth and meaning.	
25: What This Book Was About	2023-07-17	The belief that the Net is ushering us toward altogether new and redemptive social forms is a patently dangerous one. It amounts to a projection of human responsibility itself onto our machines

25: What This Book Was About	2023-07-17	our need to intensify and deepen our inner life remains primary; driven by that need, we may seek misguided fulfillment out where we have unwittingly “thrown” ourselves -- behind the interface. On the Net.	
25: What This Book Was About	2023-07-17	Intelligence -- even in its most mechanical aspect -- is not an evil. But it needs to be placed in the service of something higher	
25: What This Book Was About	2023-07-17	the willingness of users to personify computers based on the crudest mechanical manipulation of a few words is well attested	
25: What This Book Was About	2023-07-17	We can now use this programmatic mechanism to reanimate the aforementioned word-corpses. That is, the corpses begin to dance through their silicon graveyard, their stiffened meanings activated rather like dead frog legs jerking convulsively to the imperatives of an electrical beat.	
25: What This Book Was About	2023-07-17	The computer manipulates the corpses of a once-living thinking.	
25: What This Book Was About	2023-07-17	Our experiment with the computer consists of the effort to discover every possible aspect of the human mind that can be expressed or echoed mechanically -- simulated by a machine -- and then to reconstruct society around those aspects. In other words, after a few centuries of philosophical reductionism, we are now venturing into a new, practical reductionism: we are determined to find out how much of our mental functioning we can in fact delegate to the computer.	
25: What This Book Was About	2023-07-17	What we embed in the computer is the inert and empty shadow, or abstract reflection, of the past operation of our own intelligence.	
25: What This Book Was About	2023-07-17	It is not evident, then, how one is justified in speaking unambiguously of the automobile's effects, as opposed to the consequences of our own inner life -- of which the automobile itself is another result. 	
25: What This Book Was About	2023-07-17	In general, arguments for the centralizing and decentralizing cleverness of the computer continue to flourish on roughly equal terms.	
25: What This Book Was About	2023-07-17	We neither fight against technology nor consciously adapt ourselves to it. Everything happens naturally, “by force of circumstances,”

25: What This Book Was About	2023-07-20	Tom Brown, Jr., the wilderness tracker, urges the critical importance of what he calls relaxed, or wide-angle, vision. To accomplish this -- and it requires practice -- you must allow your eyes to relax “out of focus,” so that the objects directly in front of you no longer claim sole attention on the visual stage. Instead, allow your alert attention (free of sharp, visual focus) to scan all the objects in your field of vision. To prevent your gaze from hardening into an uncomprehending stare, you should continually move your eyes as well, taking care only to prevent their focusing on particular objects as they move. Your field of vision will now possess less clarity, but your breadth of awareness and ability to perceive what is going on around you will be greatly increased.

25: What This Book Was About	2023-07-20	Such a mind wants facts contained in a database. It wants knowledge about things rather than a sculpting and strengthening of the knowing gesture.	
25: What This Book Was About	2023-07-20	The discipline of consciousness is not a preparation for truth-gathering; it is the increasingly harmonious resonance between the laws of the world and the laws of our own thinking activity, which are the same laws expressed outwardly and inwardly.

Appendix A: Owen Barfield: The Evolution of Consciousness	2023-07-21	The world as immediately given to us is a mixture of sense perception and thought. While the two may not be separable in our experience, we can nevertheless distinguish the two. When we do, we find that the perceptual alone gives us no coherence, no unities, no “things” at all. We could not even note a patch of red, or distinguish it from a neighboring patch of green, without aid of the concepts given by thinking. In the absence of the conceptual, we would experience (in William James' words) only “a blooming, buzzing confusion.” (Poetic Diction; Saving the Appearances)	
Appendix A: Owen Barfield: The Evolution of Consciousness	2023-07-21	Narrower meanings conduce to accuracy of communication, and result from rational analysis. Broader meanings support fullness of expression, and result from imaginative synthesis

Appendix B: From Virtual to Real	2023-07-22	The thinking that occurs upon the stage of our consciousness takes place as much “out there” as within the cranium. Consciousness is the enduring prerequisite from which all physical reality is, as it were, coagulated
