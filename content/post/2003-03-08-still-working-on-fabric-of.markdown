Still working on _Fabric of Reality_, because I am a little lost in the chapter on quantum computing, which was the main topic I bought the book to read about. I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually.


I'm just about finished re-listening to my audio-book version of _The Fellowship of the Ring_, which I enjoyed immensely. I've now read the dead-tree book once, and listened to this audio book twice.
