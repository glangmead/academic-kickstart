I'm blogging this from a Starbucks in Hollywood, near the big shopping center called Hollywood & Highland. Alison is out with a friend nearby, so I decided to try out the Starbucks hotspot system. Works pretty well, but only for 24 hours -- next time I visit a Starbucks I'll have to pay $6 for an hour, then 10 cents a minute afterwards.
