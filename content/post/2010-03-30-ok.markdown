I've read a few theories about the origin of our expression "OK." But I haven't come across this one that occurred to me the other day. When you hold your hand in that gesture that means "OK", you make a circle with your thumb and index finger. That's an O, and your other three fingers sort of make a "K". The middle finger is the vertical stem, and the other two fingers are the diagonal ones. Just a thought.
