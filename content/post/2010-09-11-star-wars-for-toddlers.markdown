My daughter is 3, and her best friend is also 3. He has been shown the entire Star Wars trilogy already, and is in love with Darth Vader. So my daughter hears about it a lot, and is excited to see it too. Recently I showed her a couple moments from Episode 4, and she loved it. So I'm going to try to make a version of the movie that is appropriate for her. I'll edit out everything I deem too intense or violent, and see how it goes. So far, I have a rip of the DVD, and I'm trying to get it into iMovie.
