Over this holiday break, I played through all the tutorials in one of my newer DS games _[Panzer Tactics](http://www.amazon.com/Atlus-PT-00070-2-Panzer-Tactics/dp/B000TU4M4Q/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1199053915&sr=8-1)_. It's a very engrossing turn-based war game, very much along the lines of _[Advance Wars](http://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-PS2-ACT-81033-Advance/dp/B0009XEC02/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1199054118&sr=8-2)_. Panzer Tactics clicked much more with me, though, and I grasped how to deploy my units intuitively pretty quickly. I think I can take this experience back to Advance Wars as well, and have more fun with it, too. But first, I'm ready to start the real campaigns in Panzer Tactics. Then maybe I'll go back to _[Korsun Pocket](http://greg.langmead.info/?p=68)_, which is more complicated.
