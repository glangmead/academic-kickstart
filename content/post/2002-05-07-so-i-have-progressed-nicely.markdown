So I have progressed nicely in my quest to hear new music that I like. I bought two CDs! Blur's greatest hits (or is it "best of?") and Ben Folds Five (Whatever and ever amen).




I have enjoyed both, especially the Blur. I will be trying some more of their stuff very soon. I'm a little frustrated that they didn't get along with Andy Partridge when he was lined up as producer, but then again Andy is supposedly not very easy to get along with, at least when it comes to music.
