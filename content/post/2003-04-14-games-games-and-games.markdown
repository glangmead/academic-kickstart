I actually had time to play some Gameboy games today! I have quite a backlog, which will surprise no one who knows me, and it felt good to give it some attention.

My father-in-law got me [Advance Wars](http://www.gamespot.com/gba/strategy/advancewars/index.html) for Christmas, and I love it! I was afraid it would be confusing, but the designers have succeeded in making it very accessible. Any game that hides complexity with an accessible and fun interface, and especially good tutorials, becomes addictive -- it's a rule somewhere.

I also picked up [Zelda: A Link to the Past](http://www.gamespot.com/gba/action/legendofzeldaalinkttp/index.html) again. I was somewhere in the middle, and when I couldn't immediately remember what had already happened, I decided to start over. (Aside: people like me who like big games, yet have little time to devote to them often end up in the position of having to start all over to keep continuity. It adds that extra level of frustration to the sense of lost time.) Well, it turned out I was only about three minutes from the beginning! So that was a relief. Anyway, it's also a great game with very interesting maps and buildings.

Soon I hope to get Pokemon Advance, and to get back into Golden Sun.
