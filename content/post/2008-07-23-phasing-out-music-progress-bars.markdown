The iPhone does not display any progress bar or countdown to let you know when the song you're listening to will end. If you tap the screen, such a bar is temporarily displayed, but it isn't there all the time. On the classic iPod, in iTunes, and in most other software-based music players, we've been getting used to having these indicators. I don't like them because I think a song should set its own pace. I think it detracts from the listening experience to see there are 30 seconds left, because when I see that, I start thinking about how short a time that is, and will the rest of the song really fit because they have a whole other chorus to sing, etc.

I'm glad the iPhone does not show this information all the time, and I hope it becomes an option in the other players I use.
