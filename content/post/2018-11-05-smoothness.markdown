This post accompanies a pair of talks given at CMU in November 2018.

Coming soon: my notes from the talk, and possibly a screencast.

* [Wikipedia article about differential structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_structure), with a table of counts of exotic spheres.
* [The Wild World of Four-manifolds](https://bookstore.ams.org/fourman) by Alexandru Scorpan (2005), a simply wonderful resource about smooth structures in all dimensions, as a matter of fact.
* [A post that helped me](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1577985/smooth-manifold-m-is-completely-determined-by-the-ring-f) with a proof about the ring of smooth functions determining a manifold.
* [A book that looks wonderful](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540562351) (_Natural Operations in Differential Geometry_ by Kolar, Michor and Slovak, 1993), but which I've had to pilfer rudely for information about the fully faithful embedding of smooth manifolds inside the category of commutative algebras.
