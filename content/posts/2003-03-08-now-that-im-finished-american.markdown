Now that I'm finished _American Gods_, I'm just reading [_The Fabric of Reality_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/014027541X/qid=1046661995/sr=12-1/104-0484812-0662315?v=glance&s=books) by David Deutsch. It's about physics, quantum computation, DNA, and lots of other topics, sort of unified into a really interesting and idiosyncratic world-view. David Deutsch is a father of quantum computing, so he knows what he's talking about. I always prefer well-expressed personal viewpoints to bland, objective information.
