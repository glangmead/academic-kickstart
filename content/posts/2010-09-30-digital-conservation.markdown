If I'm fixing a typo where I typed "loose" instead of "lose", then is it less wasteful if I click inside and delete one of the "o"s, versus double-clicking the whole word and typing four brand new letters? If I do it the first way, it seems like I am reusing the existing four correct letters, so it seems less wasteful.
