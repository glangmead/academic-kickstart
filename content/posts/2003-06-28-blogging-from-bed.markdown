Got wireless today! It's totally new to me, but not to most other people, so I won't dwell on it. Anyway, I'm in bed, which means Penelope is in the chair and Alison's got her arms all over my pillows. This laptop has a very loud hard drive, which I already knew, but which is a bit more of a problem in this context.
