I've been trying to find simple words for this simple idea for a few years. It's the culmination of my reflections on right-wing politics since I first started visiting rushlimbaugh.com over 20 years ago. Every analysis I've seen and read has been helpful to me, but all of them lack one component.

Why do conservatives keep moving from issue to issue? Communism, terrorism, gay marriage, gun rights, abortion, Black Lives Matter, voting rights, immigration, gay marriage again, the existence of transgender people, diversity in film adaptations, "CRT", and the useful shorthand "woke" for all of the above? I claim they have no particular passion for any of these issues. I claim that they are responding to the existence of a bulk narrative, a set of agreed conclusions, that they do not control. The job of processing information and interpreting belongs to them, and they are very, very unhappy if other tribes manage to do that.

Facts impinge on all of us equally, but conservatives don't see it that way. Groups of people impinge on each other, and so if there is broad agreement about some fact, like that BLM protests were almost entirely peaceful, then they view it as information warfare, as a narrative that was brought about by a competing group. They fight back.

It puts them in the position of negating facts a lot of the time, since their opponents are not actually playing the manipulative version of the game, just admitting facts.

This will work best if I gather some headlines. You'll have to Google these yourself since I will not link to these troll farms.

1. Marjorie Taylor Greene Gets a Promotion, and Eric Swalwell Can't Deal
2. The Medical Profession Is the Newest Front in the Effort to Trans Your Kids
3. A Warning to Social Tyrants: Beware the Powerfully Motivating Force That Is Spite
4. Elon the Indestructible: Court Smacks Down Lawsuit Against Twitter Filed by Disgruntled Ex-Employees
5. CNN Cuts Away From Speaker McCarthy's First Weekly Presser as He Blasts Media Hypocrisy
6. AOC Gets Dropped by Best Self-Own Ever Over Her Gas Stove Hate
7. Biden Hides the IRS Attacks on the Poor, Claims GOP Is Protecting Billionaires With New Bill
8. Virginia Tech Soccer Player Receives $100K Settlement After Being Benched for Refusing to Kneel for BLM

Here are some from the sub-genre of "here is some pop culture viewing data that shows that our views are winning in the literal marketplace of ideas":

1. HBO's New Woke Scooby-Less 'Velma' Show Is Already Burning in a Dumpster
2. The Appeal of Traditional Values: Great American Family Is the Fastest-Growing Network in Cable Television
3. Trans Activists Try Finding New Ways of Bombing 'Hogwarts Legacy' but Only Generate More Hype
4. Will Disney Learn Anything After Its Woke Agenda Cost the Company Almost Half of Its Market Value?

and here are some that attempt to disqualify a person

1. Noted Energy Expert AOC Claims Gas Stoves Cause Brain Damage, Gets Mocked to Smithereens
2. Pfizer Board Member Scott Gottlieb Pressured Twitter to Censor Vaccine Criticism

here are ones that try to set a counternarrative, i.e. pure information warfare and bad faith at that

1. SHOCKING. Major Study Finds Russian Internet 'Troll Farms' Had No Effect on the 2016 Election
2. Democrats Claim Biden's Classified Documents Scandal is 'Different,' but the Receipts Tell a Different Story

Now put on the lens of "they aren't arguing at the level of policy, or the level of facts and details, they are pushing back on the standing of the broader community to set the narrative."

1. OpEd: I Forgot It Was January 6th

Now put on the lens of "I have my conservative, white tribe centered in my frame of reference, and then I speak." This
