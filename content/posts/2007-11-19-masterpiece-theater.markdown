Has _Masterpiece Theater_ always just been some British TV show? Lately they've been showing _The Amazing Mrs. Prithcard_, which felt like an American TV show that happened to be British. Is it a masterpiece? Did they pick it because they felt it was a masterpiece? Maybe they should rename Masterpiece Theater to "Some British TV Show".
