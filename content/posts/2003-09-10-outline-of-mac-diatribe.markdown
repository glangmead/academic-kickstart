Please understand I'm of two minds about the Mac, and so my remarks should be taken like those of a concerned parent, rather than, say, a Palestinian suicide bomber.

My main points are



  * Lack of games
  * Inadequate developer documentation, including horrifying backward steps
  * Lack of affordable hardware
  * Counterproductive "boutique" model
  * Ignorance of the real competitive advantages over Linux, Windows
  * Poorly managed transition to OS X
