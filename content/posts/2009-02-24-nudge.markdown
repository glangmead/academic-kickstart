I'm reading an interesting book about economics, public policy, and psychology. It's called [Nudge](http://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/014311526X%3FSubscriptionId%3D13D7MCZQKMM5E1WMY782%26tag%3Dshelfcentered-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D014311526X). They make many interesting points that were completely new to me about the way people do _not_ behave in the rational manner modeled by the previous generation of economists. In fact, there are systematic biases in our decision-making that can be quantified and worked around by enacting sensible policies. The cover issues ranging from the Medicare prescription drug plan to 401k plans, to organ donation, to the environment. The ideas are presented clearly with lots of examples. Highly recommended.
