I've made two changes to my video game family. First, I bought a GameCube and a couple games ([Zelda](http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/adventure/legendofzeldathewindwaker/review.html), [Viewtiful Joe](http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/action/viewtifuljoe/review.html)). Also, a friend with a vinyl cutter made a wood-grain applique for my Xbox. [Click to see the new family!](/images/GregsTrueLoves.html)
