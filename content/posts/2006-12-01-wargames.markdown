My interest in the World Wars, and my recent reading of _The Guns of August_ (Tuchman), led me somehow to look into the wargaming universe. I learned that there is of course a sizable community of computer wargamers and developers, and I took a look around the landscape and selected a few to zero in on. Some of these are on my [Christmas shelf](http://www.shelfcentered.com/index.php?event=user_shelf&userid=26&user_shelf=Christmas%202006), and some I pirated so I could read the manual and get a feel for how it goes.  It turns out the more detailed ones are more appealing so far, such as the one pictured above, [The Operational Art of War III](http://www.matrixgames.com/games/game.asp?gid=317).

What I'd like to do is to get familiar with the mechanics and idioms of the genre, and then play through some WWI and WWII scenarios to see if it really adds some depth to my understanding of the great battles of the last century.
