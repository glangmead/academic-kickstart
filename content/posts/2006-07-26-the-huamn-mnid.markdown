The rset can be a toatl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe."

I read about this a while back, but this evening it came back to me. I think I read about it before I became a natural language processing dude, but now that I deal with machines that work with language, it is one of the items I keep in the back of my mind that may be helpful some day.

Language is not data.
